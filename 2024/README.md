### ELF 32-bit

ELF is short for Executable and Linkable Format. Itâ€™s a format used for storing binaries, libraries, and core dumps on disks in Linux and Unix-based systems.

Moreover, the ELF format is versatile. Its design allows it to be executed on various processor types. This is a significant reason why the format is common compared to other executable file formats.

### ELF 64-bit

This is the 64 bit variant of the Executable and Linkable Format with only minor differences from the 32 bit version. 

The main difference between the 32-bit and the 64-bit versions lies in the differences of struct field ordering and bit widths.

### Portable Executable (PE)

Portable Executables are an executable format used in Windows and other platforms. There are different types of PEs which are noted. These are treated as distinct from the UEFI App category even though PEs can run on UEFI. See UEFI App for more info.  The types are split further into 32-bit specifically, 64-bit compatible, and 64-bit specifically, since they present different challenges.
