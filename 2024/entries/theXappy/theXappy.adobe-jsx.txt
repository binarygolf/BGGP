File Size: 84 bytes
SHA256 Hash: 38620f35729d16157645f434fb266aae056bc190ac84f07e42a4a2d66d904ba4
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): Open with Photoshop on Windows. Or from within Photoshop: "File" -> "Scripts" 
-> "Browse...".
Any additional info?:  Mostly targeted Photoshop (tested versions 20/22/24) on Windows. Did not work on Illustrator as the 
`system` API is missing. Might work on other Adobe products/Photoshop on Mac. On newer versions of PS a "Are you sure you 
want to run this script?" pop up and you have to accept.
