Target Environment (How do we run the file?): Any Linux distro (eg Ubuntu), run:
- touch x.sh # to make the empty file
- export PS1="\n$($(echo "curl https://binary.golf/5/5" >> x.sh && cat x.sh))\n└─▶ " # update file with payload, read back and exec in arg value 
Any additional info?: Unsure if this is valid, but there's nothing in rules to state the file can't be updated during execution. So file is empty to start with, updated with a Shell command, read back, executed and output used as part of a PS1 prompt, because err, fun LOL
