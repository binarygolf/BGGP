Target File Type: .bashrc
File Size: 0 or 38 bytes, I'm really unsure?
SHA256 Hash: 4c73e6a763d566490deba14e1df05ceee08b09d4f22b5cd5694ea72a837f087f
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): Run command on any Linux based OS really, eg Ubuntu:
echo 'export PS1="\n$(curl https://binary.golf/5/5)\n└──▶ "' >> .bashrc && exec $SHELL -l
Any additional info?: I'm honestly not sure if this entry is counted as 0 bytes, or 38 bytes. It needs nothing written to a file to begin with, as it's added during Shell command prompt, then shell is reloaded, and from then on automatically executed on every command prompt display. It was too fun an entry to not submit tho, so here we are. :-D

Score: 97
Note: works as is, neat trick!! counting this as 97 bytes because that is the size of the oneliner on disk.
