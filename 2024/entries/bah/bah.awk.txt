Target Environment (How do we run the file?):
`awk -E ./entry.awk  /etc/hostname`
Linux, works on GNU awk and whatever version Alpine linux uses, just needs curl installed.
Any additional info?: Just shelling out to curl. Turns out you don't need BEGIN{}, etc, as the code will run for each line passed (hense the use of /etc/hostname in the example, which has one line!)
