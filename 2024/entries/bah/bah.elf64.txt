Target File Type: ELF, for amd64 Linux
File Size: 620 bytes
SHA256 Hash: c7888d2f0346d460c875f7a70a4b0ff4ba6060187a7b1e7cd5000d8b4563e562
Target Environment (How do we run the file?):
Just chmod +x the file, and it should work if you are on a supported distro, like the ones I tested on:
* Ubuntu Linux 22.04, on the host and in docker containers for Ubuntu 24.04 and fedora:latest.
* Fedora Workstation 40, kernel version `6.8.5-301.fc4.x86_64`, the latest livecd you can download.
Requires adjusting an offset to work on debian:latest, as it doesn't included endbr4 instructions, not included but noted in the source/writeup. Arch Linux will NOT work, as the relocation type I wrote this against is not used on arch.

Doesn't use curl so should work in minimal containers, just libssl.so.3 (should be on most modern distros by default), older distros need some minor changes to work.
Any additional info?:
Patches a copy of bash in memory and does the memfd fexecve trick to run it, replacing `main()` with code that will `dlopen()` libssl and use it to download the BGGP5 file.

It shouldn't ever crash on the supported distros, but I did some horrific hacks that may have edge cases I'm not aware of.

Link to writeup, if any: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bahorn/bphage/master/src/bphage.asm Did my writeup as part of the source code, and the repo https://github.com/bahorn/bphage has history and the experiments to make it work.
