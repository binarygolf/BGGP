Target Environment (How do we run the file?): Linux shell script relying on curl in $PATH. I saw people use command line arguments, so here are mine, run the following command: bash jbo.sh "curl https://binary.golf/5/5"
Any additional info?: I think using environment variables or command line arguments is cheating, but what do I know. :)
