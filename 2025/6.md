Welcome To The Binary Golf Recycling Center! We will be accepting files for the Sixth Annual Binary Golf Grand Prix (BGGP6) from October 18th 2025 to January 18th 2026

Due to architectural constraints, files larger than 4096 bytes will NOT be accepted. Files must also print, return, or otherwise display the value "6" for identification when opened or executed, pending other restrictions or exemptions.

We will consider files of the following types:
1. [BGGP1](https://binary.golf/1/) (2020) - Palindrome - Smallest binary that executes the same backward or forward
2. [BGGP2](https://binary.golf/2/) (2021) - Polyglot - Smallest polyglot binaries, points for executing within file overlays
3. [BGGP3](https://binary.golf/3/) (2022) - Crash - Smallest file that crashes a program, points for exploits and patches
4. [BGGP4](https://binary.golf/4/) (2023) - Replicate - Smallest self replicating file, any format or platform
5. [BGGP5](https://binary.golf/5/) (2024) - Download - Smallest file that downloads another file.
6. [BGGP6](https://binary.golf/6/) (2025) - Recycle - Smallest file and/or any past challenge

Example shell script:
```sh
#!/bin/sh

printf "6\n"
```


## What Is BGGP?

Binary Golf Grand Prix is an annual small file format competition, currently in it's sixth year. The goal is to make the smallest possible file that fits the criteria of the challenge.

BGGP lasts for 3 months, and is formatted like an open-world, choose-your-own adventure CTF. Entries are verified by our team and are published on our [git repo](https://github.com/binarygolf/bggp).


## Why Recycle?

The Binary Golf Recycling Center is recycling previous BGGP challenges. We want to provide an opportunity for you to try out old challenges, attempt to beat previous records, revisit unfinished projects, or just play with file formats that pique your interest. Our goal is to make this year's BGGP accessible to all who want to explore and understand files, whether you have been playing for years or are just hearing about this right now.

We come back to old problems with better tools. You might have a dusty old directory with a BGGP entry, or other project, that you never finished. Imagine revisiting that with all you've learned since you last worked on it. You can probably make it even cooler than initially planned!

The 6 Rs of BGGP6: RECYCLE
- REDUCE - file size
- REUSE - parser & platform machinery
- RECYCLE - techniques 
- REMIX - ideas
- RESURRECT - old projects, lost formats
- REPAIR - code you find bugs in, or your own :)


## Rules & Scoring

![](assets/search_directory-5.png) ![](assets/search_directory-5.png) ![](assets/search_directory-5.png) ![](assets/search_directory-5.png) ![](assets/search_directory-5.png) ![](assets/search_directory-5.png) 

All entries must print, return, or otherwise display the value "6".

Files must be at least one byte in size and no more than 4096 bytes.

> Why 4096 bytes? Because that is the usual size of a memory page, and demoscene has proven that you can do anything in under 4kb.

"0 byte" Files are essentially one liners, and will be treated as such. We will score oneliners by the total length of the oneliner, including any setup commands.

Points are calculated by how many bytes less than 4096 your file is. For example if your file is 1024 bytes, your score is 3072. 

Additional points/recognition will be rewarded for
- +256 - Having a writeup for your entry - published prior to the end of the competition
- +256 - For each additional BGGP challenge your entry meets the requirements for. eg a palindromic (1) self-replicating (3) polyglot (2) that downloads a file (5) within the process memory (4) would give you +1024 points. The maximum is +1024 since there are only 5 previous challenges, and we assume that you are already doing 1 of them!
- +1024 - Fixing code you find a bug in that relates to your entry - Must be an open source project, buggy code must have been committed prior to the start of BGGP6, and changes must be merged before the end of BGGP6.

‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE: Some old challenges contain bespoke scoring mechanisms that will not be applied here, such as the execution ratio of palindrome or polyglot binaries in BGGP1 and BGGP2.


## How To Enter

Steps
1. Go to https://github.com/binarygolf/bggp
2. Open a new issue for an entry
3. Fill out the entry form, make sure you put what challenge number you are solving for
4. Wait for the entry to be verified

ü•∫ IMPORTANT - Please describe the environment you used! A major challenge in verifying entries can be in getting the files to run as expected.

A good entry will be well documented! Tell us as much as you can about the file and how to interact with it, including:
- The software target(s) including the version
- The target platform and CPU architecture (example, Linux/x86_64, Mac/aarch64, Raspberry Pi with Jazelle Extensions)
- Any relevant settings or config
- Link to any setup docs where relevant, or steps you took to set the software up.

If we can't set up a similar environment, then we can't verify!! 

We encourage you to use open source software versus paid software for your target. Paid software is fine as long as there is a free trial that we can use to test, or it comes bundled within a freely available ISO.

‚ö†Ô∏è ALERT: BGGP IS FOR EVERYONE -- The point of BGGP is to explore both the file's limits and your own.

BGGP is for:
- the freaks and the geeks
- the people whom bizarre errors seem to follow them wherever they go
- the clumsy ones who fall down rabbit holes just to understand their own mistake
- anyone who has been asked the question "Why would you ever want to do it that way?" or "Who asked for this?"
- all skill levels and interests

In our current world, it's important to maintain a healthy level of skepticism. Don't take anything at face value. Specifications, documentation, best practices, policy, all of these are just wishful thinking. Only what executes is real.

After 6 years of Binary Golf Grand Prix, we stay moving the needle and raising the bar. Our efforts and discoveries have expanded the global understanding of files and their capabilities. Our dataset and file experiments have been used to improve parsers and test critical file operations in orgs and projects big and small. BGGP is a 100% volunteer run event for file enjoyers. It is not sponsored by any organizations or institutions.

### What are some recommended tools for playing BGGP?

Please see the [Binary Golf Resources](/Resources.md) page for a list of tools and other useful things!

### How do I pick a file format?

Pick a file that interests you, or just look around for strange file extensions on your computer or phone. It doesn't have to be popular or even well known. 

Play around with the file and start with something simple. Get a handle on manipulating the file format, then work your way towards reducing the overall size. Explore interesting features of the format, or vendor specific additions.

### Do I have to do one of the old challenges?

No! If you want to focus on strictly the smallest file possible, do that! So long as it returns, prints, or otherwise displays "6" and is 4096 bytes or less, and greater than 1 byte.
