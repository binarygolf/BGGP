Target File Type: polyglot [ PYC + PHP + Shell (DASH) ]
SHA256 Hash: f80410ba7bc339e67b2bb5360847dbd1af78426224543dac8dad73b33d8db097
Target Environment (How do we run the file?): To run the file, please,
use Python 3.6 (docker image "python:3.6" is perfect). You may also
run it with PHP (tested on PHP 7.4.33, thus, should work, at least for
PHP >=7; Theoretically, should works from PHP4, but didn't test it
yet.). Or even the most basic shell in any Linux
("0.5.11+git20200708+dd9ef66-5" on a debian oldstable, idk the real
version number ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).
Any additional info?: The writeup will take a bit of time to be
written (I have to refill my mental energy and health before). I'll
publish it on the URI bellow ASAP.
Link to PoC video, screenshot, or console output, if any: Not yet.
