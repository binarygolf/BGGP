Target File Type: pdf

SHA256 Hash: 316a42b34e4266b1f0b8ce90e008f673f67cfc1e2cbd2005bd6eef85b8c19c13

Target Environment (How do we run the file?): Windows 11 (I'm on 25201.1000), Adobe Acrobat 8 Standard (I used https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A80aa8c58-2951-494e-808a-fb61a6b4aa29 and the serial at https://archive.org/details/acrobat-8)

Any additional info?: In order to solve not being able to open cmd in a local path (and to golf better), the payload searches your entire computer for files named exactly "4" (which this pdf should be). It also preserves the directory structure (to golf better) when it copies it into %TMP%. As a result the copy takes a very long time to run, if you are just testing it I recommend replacing "robocopy ./" with "robocopy PATH_TO_DIR_CONTAINING_PDF". The file should copy itself then echo 4 to the terminal. Since I cant get a working directory or local directory in pdf it is essential that the file be named "4" exactly. Also, you need to accept a prompt for the cmd to kick off, digging for an old enough copy that it is still able to open a shell on Windows 11 was hard enough so I didn't bother finding one without the prompt.
